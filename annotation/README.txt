1. Overview.  

This direction contains a sub-directory for each form of annotation
performed on the MEVA data.  Crowd-supported annotations will be
provided within this directory when they become available.

Presently, there is a single directory 'DIVA-phase-2' which holds the
example annotations of the Known Facililty Data annotated by Kitware
Inc. according to the activity definitions in
'meva-data-repo/documents/MEVA-Annotation-Definitions.pdf' and
provided as JSON-formatted files described in
'meva-data-repo/documents/MEVA_Annotation_JSON.pdf'.
