# MEVA-Data-Repo Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the MEVA dataset.

* [MEVA Annotation Definitions](MEVA-Annotation-Definitions.pdf) defines the activities and objects which are being evaluated as part of the [NIST ActEV SDL evaluation](https://actev.nist.gov).

* [The KPF annotation specification](KPF-specification-v4.pdf) describes the YAML-based schemas used to annotate the activities and objects.

* [The NIST json schemas](nist-json-for-actev) are derived from the KPF and are used by NIST for scoring in ActEV.
